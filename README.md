Sparcade is a browser-based game server based on the IntelÂ® Edison. As a stand-alone access point ("dark node") and web server, it serves up a simple arcade game ([Vortex](https://github.com/ShawnHymel/Vortex)) to user's browsers. If a player gets a high score (among other players), their score and initials are added to a top 10 list that is displayed on a LCD connected to the Edison.
